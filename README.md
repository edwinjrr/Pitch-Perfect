# Pitch-Perfect
First project of the iOS Developer Nanodegree.

The Pitch Perfect app allows users to record a sound using the deviceâ€™s microphone. It then allows users to play the recorded 
sound back with six different sound modulations: Chipmunk, Darth Vader, Super Slow, Super Fast, Echo and Reverb.
